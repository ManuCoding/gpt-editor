# ChatGPT Generated Text Editor
ChatGPT is good at a couple of things, including writing code.
I tested its capabilities and made it write a code editor under the following constraints:
- The user input must be on a textarea
- It should update accordingly an HTML `<div>` in the background
- Auto indentation on newline
- Auto closing brackets and quotes

Future plans will be to add more features, but this is a dummy project.
